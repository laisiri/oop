Object Oriented Programming in Javascript

Wikipedia defines it:
Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm base on the concept of OBJECT which may contain data,in the form of fields,often known as attributes;and code, in the form of procedures,often known as methods.

OOP Principles
1. Abstraction
    The main idea of abstraction is to define real-life components in different complex data types. In most OOP languages it is implemented with class keyword,so basic understanding of it can be something like a custom data type. More deeply,class implementation of a concrete data structure with functionality implemented in methodes.
    Class is like a template for creating multiple objects with same list of properties but different data values saved in it.
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Encapsulation
